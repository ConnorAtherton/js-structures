**Divide and Conquer Algorithms**
Algorithms that solve problems by dividing them into smaller sub-problems until the problem is so
small that it is trivially solved.

**In Place**
In place sorting algorithms don't require additional temporary space to store elements
as they sort; they use the space originally occupied by the elements. This usually leads
to solutions where the elements are swapped, requiring at least some small auxiliary storage.

**Stable Sort**
A sort is stable if it maintains the relative orders of elements with equal values after it has
completed the sort.
