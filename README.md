# jsStructures ![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ConnorAtherton/js-structures.svg) ![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/ConnorAtherton/js-structures/badge.svg?branch=master)

My js playground.

## To test

```js
make install-deps
make test
```

## Layout

`dist/scratch` - Each file contains a small code snippet demonstrating one technique
or solving a very narrow problem. Execute each file from the shell, some accept arguments
passed to the script. Be sure to give the user execution permissions on the folder once
the js files are built `chmod u+x dist/scratch`.
